# 🎮 EduQuest – Educational Game Platform
**EduQuest** is an interactive **educational game platform** developed as a **Third-Year Minor Project** 
under *Project Based Learning: Minor Project–I* for the academic year **2025–2026**. The platform is 
designed to make learning more **engaging, interactive, and enjoyable** for school students by integrating 
curriculum-based concepts with game mechanics.

## 📘 Project Overview
Traditional learning methods often rely heavily on textbooks and rote memorization, which can reduce student engagement and conceptual understanding. EduQuest aims to bridge this gap by introducing **game-based learning** that combines academics with interactive gameplay. The platform consists of **three educational mini-games**, each targeting a different learning objective while encouraging problem-solving, critical thinking, and self-paced learning.
